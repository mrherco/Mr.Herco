<h3 align="center">✷ Blue Team [EH] | Cybersecurity Researcher | Vulnerability Assessment ✷</h3>

---

I am an **upper-intermediate cybersecurity professional** with a primary focus on **SOC operations and Blue Team defensive security**, supported by **controlled Red Team techniques** for Vulnerability Assessment, pentesting, and research.  
I understand **real-world attack methodologies**—from reconnaissance and exploitation to lateral movement—and apply this knowledge to **design, evaluate, and improve defensive controls**.
I use **AI tools as an advanced assistant**, not as a dependency—leveraging them to **accelerate research, cross-check findings, analyze large datasets, and validate hypotheses**, while maintaining full analytical control, similar to how an expert cybersecurity researcher operates.
