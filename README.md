<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Mr. Herco 👋</h1>
<h3 align="center">SOC & Blue Team Analyst | Vulnerability Assessment | Cybersecurity Researcher | Social Engineering Expert</h3>

---

## 🧠 Professional Profile

I am an **upper-intermediate cybersecurity professional** with a primary focus on **SOC operations and Blue Team defensive security**, supported by **controlled Red Team techniques** for validation, testing, and research.  
I understand **real-world attack methodologies**—from reconnaissance and exploitation to lateral movement—and apply this knowledge to **design, evaluate, and improve defensive controls**.
I use **AI tools as an advanced assistant**, not as a dependency—leveraging them to **accelerate research, cross-check findings, analyze large datasets, and validate hypotheses**, while maintaining full analytical control, similar to how an expert cybersecurity researcher operates.
